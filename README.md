Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintaince of high quality software system.
It helps to create high quality software that are used in various industries and for various purposes.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the development of software engineering 
establishment of software engineering as a discipline - this happened in the 1960s and software engineering was recognised 
the advent of structured programming 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements: This involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements 
Design: Creating high level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
implementation: Writing code and building software according to design specifications 
testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall :Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards loke a waterfall while Agile : iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change 
for agile an example can be when developing a new website
for waterfall an example can be developing an electronic device


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions 
Quality assurance engineer: ensures quality by desiging and excuting test plans 
project manager: overseas the planning, execution and delivery of software projects 



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
simplifys the process of managing code
enhances productivity


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements : requirements may change during the development life cycle leading to project delays. a way to overcome is to use an agile approach 
Tigt deadlines: pressure to deliver software products on a schedule . a way to minimise this is by creating a wide time scope


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of software 
Integration: testing interactions between different components 
stytem testing: testing the entire software system as a whole 
acceptance testing : testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be intepreted and understood by an ai model.
it makes it easy for users to get relevant results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tips for good hair.
what are the best practices to have long , thick and oily hair.
